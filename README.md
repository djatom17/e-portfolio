  - Upload/edit Work and Education history
  - Upload/delete files such as certificates/academic papers etc.
  - Upload/delete social media links
  
 ## User Interface
 
 The web-app UI is built from React JS components and can be divided into two parts, site-wide components such as the navbar and page-specific components for each page.
 
 The react components are arranged on the page using custom CSS. 
 
 This way we have set up preset Layouts for the clients to select.
